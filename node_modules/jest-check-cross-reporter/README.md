# Jest Check Cross reporter

**Credits first!** This is a quick'n'dirty variation, heavily based on [Jacob O'Donnell](https://github.com/jodonnell)'s
[Simple dot reporter for jest](https://github.com/jodonnell/jest-simple-dot-reporter).

This reporter displays a green check when a test passes, a red cross with an error message when the test fails.

That's pretty much it!
